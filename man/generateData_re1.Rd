\title{Simulate summary statistics according to random effects model.}
\usage{
generateData_re1(M = 50 * 10^3, p = 0.01, tau2 = 0.00025,
  resref = NULL, n = rep(50 * 10^3, 10), I2 = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{number of SNPs for which to simulate summary stats.}

\item{p}{proportion of SNPs with real non-zero effects.}

\item{tau2}{variance of real associated non-zero SNPs.}

\item{resref}{an optional vector of residual variances to sample from (with replacement) 
when generating the standard errors for the summary stats.  Default is NULL, in which case the residual variances calculated from a Cigarretes Per Day GWAS (Liu, Jiang 2019)  are used.}

\item{n}{vector of sample sizes from the contributing studies.}

\item{I2}{the I2 heterogeneity statistic for each SNP. 
The variance of study-level effects around population level effect at each SNP 
is specified given I2 level (between 0,1) and the simulated standard errors.}

\item{alpha}{variance inflation factor of outlier studies.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
 An Mxk matrix of effect size estimates \code{betajk},

 an M-length binary vector indicating real / non-real effect at each SNP \code{Rj},
 an M-length binary vector indicating true effect-size at each SNP \code{muj}.
